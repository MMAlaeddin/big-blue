        <ul>
            <li>Mariam</li>
            <li>Kevin</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Adventures!</h3>
        <p>Big Blue is meant to be a road warrior.  Wandering terrains meant for GX470s!  Going over hills and into skipping through dusty lands.  Giving the drivers a an opportunity to explore territory that is unreachable in a regular vehicle.  With a camper on top, Big Blue allows comfort for overnight adventures as well!
