        <h2>Fun facts about Big Blue!</h2>

        <h3>The Drivers!</h3>
        <p>They need no introduction but I will give one anyway.  They're YOUNG, they're in love and they have an awesome partnership!  They are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mariam - she builds the tents</li>
            <li>Kevin - he builds the fires</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Adventures!</h3>
        <p>Big Blue is meant to be a road warrior.  Wandering terrains meant for GX470s!  Going over hills and skipping through dusty lands.  Giving the drivers an opportunity to explore territory that is unreachable in a regular vehicle.  With a camper on top, Big Blue allows comfort for overnight adventures as well!  Here is a list of a couple nights she got to spend out with Mariam and Kevin:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pewitt Ridge
                <ul>
                    <li>This was Blue's first off roading adventure!  The trail ended at the top of a mountain overlooking the Pacific Ocean.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>San Benito
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a stop on the way down to Big Sur.  The drive in was late in the evening but man was it nice!  It was the first time we all ever saw wild pigs!!  What a fun journey and freezing, cold night!</li>
